Changes in 1.5-0

  * eba.order.R (new set of functions): fitting and testing EBA models
    that include a within-pair order effect
  * OptiPt: add names to the parameter estimates
  * print.strans: replace printCoefmat by print, now it prints
    "0" (not "NaN") when there are no SST violations
  * strans.Rd (value): update
  * heaviness.Rd (source): put original reference to the data
  * DESCRIPTION file (Date, Version, URL): 1.5-0, new web address

Changes in 1.4-3

  * BUG FIX: group.test now returns the correct log-likelihoods (the
    combinatorial constant is added to the models for the *pooled* data
    and not, as it was in 1.4-2, to the group model; this leaves the
    deviances unchanged, but the logLik's are now correct)
  * circular.R (new function): number of circular triads and indices of
    inconsistency
  * L.constrained (new function): constrained minimization
  * eba.boot.constrained (new function): bootstrapping using constrained
    minimization
  * OptiPt: add "constrained" argument for constrained minimization
    defaults to TRUE, parameters are constrained to be positive
  * boot.R: add "constrained" argument, see OptiPt
    add try() method in order to catch nlm errors
  * group.test: add "constrained" argument, see OptiPt
  * cov.u: add dimnames
  * weights data: rename to heaviness (weights is an existing function name)
  * plot.eba: add ... argument to plot
  * OptiPt.Rd (arguments, usage: method for summary.eba): update
  * boot.Rd (arguments): update
  * plot.eba.Rd (arguments, examples, usage: method): update
  * residuals.eba.Rd (usage, method): update
  * group.test.Rd (details, references): update
  * DESCRIPTION (Date, Version): 1.4-3

Changes in 1.4-2

  * kendall.u.R (new function): Kendall's u coefficient of agreement
  * eba (new function): wrapper for OptiPt
  * logLik.eba (new function)
  * weights (new data set): illustrate choice models with order effects
  * group.test: add combinatorial constant to logLik of all group models
  * Check strans for matrices: bug? No, returns NaN if there are no
    violations
  * OptiPt: add dimnames for fitted eba objects
  * celebrities data: add rownames
  * pork data: add dimnames
  * group.test.Rd (details): update
  * OptiPt.Rd (usage, arguments, details): update
  * strans.Rd (value, references): update
  * celebrities.Rd (description, source, examples): update
  * pork.Rd (description, source, examples): update
  * DESCRIPTION (Version, Date): 1.4-2
